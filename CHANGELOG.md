## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **All-around 3D texture — multi-view bake engine (Phase 4b)** — `generate.py finalize-texture --from
  <glb> --views front,right,back,left` bakes N corrected views into one albedo atlas so the back/sides
  carry real color (Phase 4a colored only from one front projection). New `_common.bake_multiview`
  generalizes `bake_albedo` from 1 → N views: a ring camera per view, a per-view `world_to_camera_view`
  projection UV (headless-safe), a per-view front-facing weight `max(0,dot(N,-dir))²`, a weighted blend
  `Σ(w·c)/max(Σw,ε)`, and a flat `--back-fill` (`palette`/`grey`) for faces no view sees; EMIT-baked to a
  `--texture-res` atlas, rewired as Base Color, exported as a textured GLB with orbit verification stills.
  New `mesh_finalize.py` template; CLI runs the existing Blender job runner, routes the GLB + a contact
  sheet to `outputs/`, writes a `kind:"render" mode:"finalize-texture"` sidecar (view basenames +
  azimuths). Pure bpy/Cycles — never touches the blocked `custom_rasterizer` path. **Live-validated on
  Blender 5.1.2 / RTX 5090**: a 4-distinct-colour-view bake of a sphere put all four colours in the baked
  atlas (R 13% · G 14% · B 12% · Y 22%), end-to-end CLI routed + sidecared, partial-view back-fill
  confirmed. Views are supplied today (artist/manual). **Roadmap:** the **ComfyUI depth-ControlNet +
  IPAdapter auto-repaint** that *generates* the N views from the concept (+ its `render_views` per-view
  depth/normal pass renderer) — pure inference, NOT wheel-blocked, but new models (~2–3 GB) + ~32 GB VRAM
  peak, so deferred to a VRAM-free, attended run.
- **Headless FreeCAD `cad` subcommand** — `generate.py cad` drives `FreeCADCmd` (GUI-less) as a normal
  CLI subprocess to author and convert CAD geometry, completing FreeCAD's headless path (the peer of the
  Phase-2 Blender render backend; the interactive MCP bridge stays Phase 1). Two modes:
  - `--mode primitive` *(default)*: build a parametric solid — `--shape box|cylinder|cone|sphere|tube`
    with mm dimensions (`--length/--width/--height/--radius/--radius2/--inner-radius`);
  - `--mode convert`: import a CAD/mesh file (`--from` step/stp/iges/igs/brep or stl/obj) and re-export.
  Exports any subset of **STEP / STL / OBJ** (`--formats`, default `step,stl`) — STEP is the BREP
  authoring Blender can't do; glTF is GUI-only in FreeCAD, so STL is the bridge into `render --mode mesh`.
  Job runner `scripts/brandkit/freecad.py` (params via a temp JSON file — `FreeCADCmd` has no `--`
  separator; mockable `_runner` seam for GPU-free CI), templates in `workflows/templates/freecad/`
  (`_common`/`primitive`/`convert`), `kind:"cad"` reproducibility sidecar (`sidecar.build_cad_meta`),
  friendly host-side validation (formats, positive dims, tube bore, cone tip, convert source allowlist,
  mesh→STEP refusal). STEP/IGES/BREP outputs route to `outputs/3d/`. **Live-validated on FreeCAD 1.1.1**
  (tube `solids:1` STEP+STL, STEP→STL convert, end-to-end CLI routing + sidecar). The FreeCAD
  self-correction loop (`cad → render → judge`) remains roadmap.
- **3D albedo texturing (Phase 4a)** — `auto_generate.py --pipeline mesh3d --texture` restores color to
  the 3D self-correction loop via a headless Blender bake (pure bpy/Cycles — never touches the blocked
  `custom_rasterizer` path). `_common.bake_albedo()` smart-UV-unwraps the mesh, projects the concept
  image from a front camera (computed with `world_to_camera_view` — headless-safe, since
  `uv.project_from_view` needs a VIEW_3D region), shader-masks front faces vs a flat **`--back-fill`**
  (`palette` = brand color, default; `mirror` = back-projected flipped concept), and EMIT-bakes a
  `--texture-res` albedo atlas; `mesh_eval` assigns it as Base Color, renders colored stills, and
  exports a self-contained **textured GLB**. The 3D rubric regains color/palette criteria via a
  **thrash-safe** wording (`build_rubric(..., textured=True)` — "a plain or palette-filled back is
  acceptable", so the loop never chases back texture a single front image can't produce); a
  `<stem>.texture.json` sidecar records the textured status + GLB name. **Live-validated on Blender
  5.1.2 / RTX 5090** (front-faithful projection, palette + mirror back-fills, embedded GLB — the smoke
  caught and fixed the headless `project_from_view` bug); the full `--texture` loop end-to-end is
  pending a ComfyUI run. **Roadmap:** generated all-around texture (Phase 4b — depth-ControlNet
  multi-view repaint on the winning mesh; in-ComfyUI Hunyuan3D-Paint stays wheel-blocked).
- **3D self-correction over Blender renders (Phase 3)** — `auto_generate.py --pipeline mesh3d`
  extends the self-correction loop to 3D: a brief becomes a concept image (txt2img, or `--from-image`
  to fix the concept and reroll only the mesh), the concept becomes a Hunyuan3D mesh, the mesh is
  rendered headlessly to a **4-view contact sheet** (new `workflows/templates/blender/mesh_eval.py`),
  and a **form** rubric (`build_rubric(..., modality="3d")`) is judged on the grey-clay render. A new
  `GeometryAwareJudge` folds **deterministic bmesh geometry checks** (non-manifold edges, open/boundary
  edges, loose parts, empty/zero-tri, zero-extent bounds) into the verdict — defects a VLM can't see.
  The model-free loop core,
  `parse_verdict`, the expander, and `ConsensusJudge` are reused unchanged; the loop's per-iteration
  seed advance gives an implicit mesh reroll. Host-side contact-sheet montage in
  `scripts/brandkit/montage.py` (Pillow, optional `[images]` extra). GPU-free CI (mocked ComfyUI
  client + Blender runner); `mesh_eval` (render + 4 orbit stills + bmesh geometry checks + montage) is
  **live-validated on Blender 5.1.2 / RTX 5090** — that caught and fixed a glTF vertex-split topology
  bug — with the full ComfyUI→Hunyuan3D→judge loop pending a live run.

  **Roadmap:** Texturing (now shipped as Phase 4a above; all-around generative texture is Phase 4b);
  and FreeCAD headless self-correction.
- **Headless Blender render backend (Phase 2)** — `generate.py render` shells to
  `blender --background --python` with parameterized `bpy` templates from
  `workflows/templates/blender/`, backed by a job runner in `scripts/brandkit/blender.py`.
  Three modes, all live-validated on Blender 5.1 / RTX 5090:
  - `--mode mesh` *(default)*: import a mesh (GLB/STL/OBJ) → studio look → Cycles → hero PNG
    (+ `--turntable` MP4);
  - `--mode comfy-scene`: ComfyUI image → emissive backdrop + reflective floor + focal object →
    Cycles render (the ComfyUI → Blender handoff);
  - `--mode finish`: AI mesh → clean → optional `--watertight` voxel remesh → decimate
    (`--target-tris`) → optional `--scale-mm` → material (or `--color project`) → export
    STL/GLB (+ hero render) — the figurine/character-finish pipeline for print-ready output.
  Brand-aware (routes to `brands/<brand>/outputs/` + `kind:"render"` sidecar). Runs as a normal
  CLI subprocess — **no per-call MCP approval** (unlike the interactive bridge's gated
  `execute_blender_code`). CI tests mock the subprocess; GPU-free. Requires Blender ≥ 5.1 on PATH
  or `$BLENDER_BIN`; Cycles GPU (OptiX/CUDA); MP4 via Blender's bundled FFmpeg. (Phase 3 — VLM
  self-correction over these renders — shipped; see above. **FreeCAD headless `cad`** is now shipped too
  — see above.)
- **DCC/CAD bridges (Phase 1)** — assistant-driven MCP bridges to **Blender** (official Blender
  Foundation `lab/blender_mcp` @ `03004fd`, GPL-3.0, loopback :9876) and **FreeCAD**
  (`neka-nat/freecad-mcp` @ `63acb30`, MIT, loopback :9875), repositioning Chimera as a generative +
  DCC/CAD orchestration hub. Both are **pinned, from-source audited, and per-tool gated** (Tier-1
  code-exec tools require per-call approval — guarded by `tests/test_mcp_gates.py`). New
  `modules/blender/` + `modules/cad/` docs; weekly pin checks extended to Blender's Gitea
  (`check_gitea_pack`) and FreeCAD's GitHub repo (existing `check_git_pack`) in
  `scripts/update_report.py`. **Interactive only** — headless automation + 3D/CAD self-correction
  are roadmap (Phase 2–3).

## [0.1.3] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- **Reliable update process** — a weekly scheduled job (`.github/workflows/update-check.yml` +
  `scripts/update_report.py`) opens a "🔄 Weekly update report" issue flagging when a pinned node
  pack / the MCP server falls behind upstream (**report-only** — never auto-bumps a pin), plus
  `docs/UPDATING.md`, the safe per-layer update runbook (with a quarterly model-review cadence).
  Makes the previously-aspirational "scheduled re-scan" doc claim real.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- **`docs/STACK.md`** — a consolidated dependency / stack inventory (Python packages, ComfyUI core,
  pinned third-party node packs + audit status, MCP bridge, model defaults, CI actions, host stack)
  with a layer diagram. Linked from the README.
- **Animated self-correction demo** (`docs/images/agent-correct.gif`) as the README hero, plus a
  data-flow **mermaid diagram** ("How it works").
- **Brandless self-correction demo** — a chimera with a missing serpent-headed tail, corrected by the
  same loop against a *subject + quality* rubric (no brand), shown alongside the branded *style*
  correction in `modules/agent/self-correction.md`. Locked in with a brandless-correction unit test.
- Project hygiene: this `CHANGELOG.md`, a `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, and a (non-blocking) `pip-audit`
  CI step for dependency advisories.
- `CLAUDE.md`: a **"keep docs in sync"** convention (every behavior/dep/test-count change updates the
  matching docs) plus a Structure-tree refresh (`STACK.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`), so the living docs stay
  current as the project evolves.

### Changed
- The self-correction showcase now uses a **same-subject** fail→pass — a six-wheeled rover corrected
  from a glossy candy/toy finish to on-brand gunmetal tactical armor (same seed). The *brand* is what
  visibly gets corrected, not the subject, so the loop reads clearly.
- Expanded the `ruff` lint set from `F` to `F, B, UP` (correctness + likely-bug + modern-syntax rules;
  the stylistic `E`/`I` rules stay off by design — the codebase uses compact one-liners and a
  `sys.path` shim).

### Fixed
- `modules/image/brand-kits.md` "modes → templates" table corrected to the **Z-Image** defaults
  (`brand-zimage-*.json`); FLUX.2 is documented as the secondary fallback.
- LTX-2.3 node pack now **pinned to audited commit `229437c`** in `docs/CATALOG.md` and
  `modules/video/models.md` (it was previously unpinned, unlike the other two packs).
- `pyproject.toml` package version bumped to `0.1.2` (it was stale at `0.1.0` — behind even the
  released v0.1.1).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-09
### Added
- **Brandless self-correction** — `auto_generate.py --brand` is optional; the brandless rubric is
  subject + quality and winners route to the global `outputs/`.
- **Optional, agent-gated assistant-consensus judge** — `consensus_verdict()` + a `CallableJudge`
  seam; `--backend assistant` is offered but refused in a headless run (no assistant vision present).
- A real fail→pass artifact with verbatim judge traces.

### Changed
- README reframed agent-first / brand-optional. Codecov `patch` status made informational. Test count
  badge/claim corrected to 314.

### Fixed
- Strict rubric + structured `FIX: add…; avoid…` directives; the expander strips off-brand terms from
  the positive prompt (Z-Image zeroes the text negative).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-09
### Added
- Initial public release: brand-aware multimodal ComfyUI pipeline (image / video / audio / 3D), the
  agent self-correction loop (local Qwen2.5-VL judge), reproducible replay + provenance sidecars,
  `new-brand` / `lint` / `doctor` / `update-check`, the hardened MCP bridge, a GPU-free test suite,
  cross-platform CI, and `pip`-installable packaging.
